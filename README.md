Once we have the mac address, we can use this info to register manually the dashbutton using this GET :

# Sniff ARP packet from the Dash Button

The script allow to ESP8266 chip to "sniff" the messages from the DashButton mac, once that is recognized a funcion is called by the Wemos, so any IFTTT or extra configurazion is required. We need only a DashButton and an Wimos D1mini
